    <h2>What order should one place different values in life?</h2>
<p class="highlighted">The will to live. </p>
<p>This is so fundamental to life that we often fail to see how
    important it is. It is the very life force within us that makes us want to go on
    with life despite the many struggles. Many religions and spiritualities view this
    creative force as GOD, most of us in times of crisis look to our faith in our
    beliefs to go on. It is a selfish desire and puts ones survival above all others,
    hence the modern term, Love of self. Fundamentalist extreme religious belief
    or a dictator can result in a perfectly healthy individual voluntarily taking their
    life. In times of crisis such as war, others are asked to risk their lives for a
    cause; many have fallen for their country! Our conscious intellect is our most
    advanced or weakness for survival, depending on the rationality of our
    thinking and observation of the reality of life. Put simply, humans have the
    capacity to choose to live. It has also led to modern phrases like, Love of life
    or Compassion for life.</p>
<p class="highlighted">The basic essentials of survival.</p> 
<p>This is the water, food and shelter
    from bad weather conditions that each individual requires to stay alive. Almost
    half of the world population lives on US $2.5 per day. Approximately
    R500/month.</p>
</p>
<p class="highlighted">	Health of the individual.</p>

<p>After famine, wars and natural disasters, it is
    4. disease which is our biggest problem with living our lives. Mental health is
    probably more important than physical. Serious physical disability can be
    overcome if the mind is healthy.</p>
<p class="highlighted">Work.</p>

<p>This is ones main occupation that makes up the days of our lives.
    Work may be as a house executive, collecting wood and water or running a
    company. It usually is required to be able to provide for 2.</p>


<p class="highlighted">	Relationships.</p>

<p>Often when patients are asked, “what is their main priority
    in life?” this is the answer. There are relationships such as “Romeo and Juliet”,
    a Shakespearian tragedy in which a love is of such intensity that it may be the
    will to live. In most relationships it is necessary to take care of 1 to 4 first to
    ensure you are of value to the relationship.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Benevolence, Compassion or Reverence for life. </p>

<p>Ones ability to
    associate with others and have an understanding of the common life force in
    all of us. This is an appreciation of the co dependence of ecological systems
    and diversity of life on our planet. Also the rarity of life in the known
    universe.</p>

<p class="highlighted">Others such as recreation, art and creativity.</p>

<p>The order and type of
    activity can vary according to the individual.
