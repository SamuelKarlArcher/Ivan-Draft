    <h2>Dr L.M Archers Professional Summary </h2>
<p>My medical training started at the age of 18 years in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia). I spent a year in active combat as an army medic, which led me into the field of medicine. Zimbabwe medical care collapsed, resulting myself, wife and two children immigrating to South Africa. My present practice has served an isolated rural community of approximately 10 000 people from the poorest to richest for past 37 years.</p>
