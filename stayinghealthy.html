    <h2>How is illness likely to affect my life and what can I do about it. 
        </h2>
<p class="highlighted">Genetic</p>
<p>What genes you have from your mother and father is probably the most important determinate of your health. Your genetic make-up. Present genetic information tests are of insufficient understanding to be of great value but are useful for specific disorders.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p class="highlighted">Environment and Nutrition. </p> 
<p>A Safe environment is essential for healthy growth and development. It starts in the uterus, a mother drinking excessive alcohol or smoking will damage the unborn. A mother taking large doses of Vitamin A will cause deformity in the developing baby. Excessive radiation in the environment like after the Chernobyl disaster caused children to get leukemia. Africa suffers with famine resulting in lots of children to have malnutrition. Nutrition is very important but despite diverse cultural diets, when food selection is available, deficiency is rare. The developed world’s food industry is about money and is not health driven and is responsible for many common serious global diseases, such as Obesity, Diabetes, Cancer, Addiction and many of the top disease killers of the modern world.</p>
</p>
<p class="highlighted">	Sensory stimulation.</p>

<p>This is essential to normal child’s central nervous system development. If a child is removed from sensory input, the child’s brain will fail to develop properly and there will be mental retardation. Children severely deprived of emotion and human contact fail to speak or develop social skills.</p>
</p>
<p class="highlighted">Safe environment. Avoid toxic agents. </p>

<p>Humans need protection from harsh environmental elements, infective agents and harmful foods. Natural disasters and many other types of dangerous surroundings often will cause deaths. Small children living next to a busy road are at risk of being run over. Smoking and alcohol are major contributors to ill health in communities. Other drugs whether legal or illegal are also major contributors to disease. Doctors probably kill more people than illicit drug dealers. Correct use of medicine whether scheduled or alternative requires skill in their use. Self-medication is a major cause of death.</p>


<p class="highlighted">	Geographic areas. </p>

<p>The so called Blue Zones, labeled by National Geographic magazine. These are areas in the world were communities are known generally to live long and healthy lives. This is related to a clean environment and healthy cultural nutrition, combined with active physical life style and good community support.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	First world scientific medicine.  </p>

<p>Average lifespan has increased from approximately 38yrs to 74yrs due to availability of modern health service. Remove scientific medicine and it reverts to 38yrs, as in the Zaire of central Africa.</p>

<p class="highlighted">Accessing first world medical care</p>

<p>It is no good having modern medicine unless it is accessed. This is a recent trend where people are reverting back to herbal and mystic medicine. Partly the fault of the modern medical doctor’s lack of professional conduct. Simple things we take for granted like making sure you have obstetric care, all checkups in childhood and, 
	Doing annual checkups with sensible medical advice and seeking medical help early when problems arise goes a long way to ensuring good health.
</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Having family and community support. </p>

<p>Men being married statistically live longer lifespans than unmarried men. Close family and community go a long way to caring for the sick and helping each other in the time of need. Western culture of having separate family homes is probably not the easiest way to live. We all will have our moments when we are helpless!</p>

<h2>Important points to be aware of</h2>

<p class="highlighted">	Expect to be ill.  </p>

<p>Illness is part of life! On average a person who lives 72yrs can expect to be suffering from ill health approximately 11yrs. Most of this will occur immediately after birth, then after 9months of age to 5years, during pregnancy if you are female and old age especially the weeks before death.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Crisis of ill health.  </p>

<p>We all take good health for granted, until one of us or our family gets sick and then it quickly becomes a crisis, because it is unexpected and we have lifestyles that do not cater for this eventuality. As patients we then demand a quick fix, so we can continue with our busy lives. Prevent and prepare for the possibility, as ill health will happen!</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Clean water and basic sanitation.   </p>

<p>This is the most important disease prevention, and has been known since 10 000yrs+ B.C. Today many places including SA, do not have this most basic essential service. Cholera and typhoid are clear indicators of a crisis in this basic requirement for health.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Vaccinations.   </p>

<p>This is the single most important part of modern medicine you can do to prevent illness. It is a specific immune-booster for a particular infective agent. Vaccines are generally very safe and highly effective with outstanding health results. A wide range of vaccines are available, and one should ensure that your doctor has informed you of all the options. Unfortunately, the recent controversy around Covid-19 vaccines has caused considerable harm to modern medicine. There are unsafe and unnecessary vaccines, a well-informed doctor will advise regarding these matters.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Immune booster.   </p>

<p>There are no convincing general immune boosters of the immune system. So save your money and don’t buy these products. Good general health will ensure your immune system is healthy. You want a balanced healthy immune system. You do not want an overactive or boosted immune system as this can lead to allergies and auto immune diseases.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Vitamins, minerals and nutritional supplements  </p>

<p>All have actions on or are substrates of the biochemical systems of the body. So like all medicines, it is the dosage interacting with your particular body systems that will determine whether it is of no influence, therapeutic or a poison. So if you are not sure, do not use them. The most natural therapy is to allow your own body to prevent disease or heal. Do not take anything unless there is strong medical evidence for its use in your situation. If you do not know this, ask a qualified person who does. There is no evidence that these products are of any value unless there is a deficiency in your body, and you require it. Since there is so much vitamin fortification of modern food by food industry as a sales or legal requirement and most of us do eat diverse food groups, it is unlikely that supplements are required. The risk of excess vitamins causing harm may be higher than the possible benefit. Again the indication are well established, unfortunately the fashion and hype has confused many people including medical people, either for financial gain or lack of quality of medical statistical analysis of well conducted double blind trials. More is not necessarily better!</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Herbal medicine.    </p>

<p>The active chemical ingredient (drug) in herbs that acts on your body to cause a biochemical alteration (an effect) is in most cases identical to the scheduled medicines that are available in tablet form. The error in the logic is that there is any difference, lack of knowledge of the correct dose in the herb is what makes it nonsensible. The dose in herbs is usually below effective therapeutic level or more concerning may be at toxic levels. An unknown active ingredient in herbs is common which makes the likelihood of toxicity great if used in large quantities. Most herbs like spirulina, blue - green algae are of no pharmaceutical benefit. Yet others like tobacco which has had extensive investigation are known not only to contain beneficial pharmaceutical agents but also carcinogenic agents. Most herbs if analyzed are likely to be similar to tobacco, most chemicals inert, some beneficial, some harmful. It is not a lot different to a doctor getting several medicines out of the medicine cupboard and crushing them together and giving you a pinch, then hoping something will work.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Do an annual checkup.   </p>

<p>Each individual is uniquely different and require medical screening and medical advice suitable for them. Your GP looks at you as a whole body and mind in a particular community. The aim is to prioritize your health needs and get them done in order of importance and cost effectiveness. The level of health care you want can be aimed as low or as high as you want. The important point is to do what will give you the most benefit when looking at, time, invasiveness, cost and outcome.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Follow doctor’s instructions and come in when advised.   </p>

<p class="highlighted">	Scripts have to by law be renewed six monthly.  </p>

<p>Considered to be the minimum safety standard for the patient.  Come in for this only, with all your medicines, so everything can be checked and your underlying conditions for which the medicines are being used can be checked. It is illegal to do this over the phone, because it is dangerous to your health!</p>

<p>There are no convincing general immune boosters of the immune system. So save your money and don’t buy these products. Good general health will ensure your immune system is healthy. You want a balanced healthy immune system. You do not want an overactive or boosted immune system as this can lead to allergies and auto immune diseases.</p>


<h2>So what are the top Five killers in the modern world, that I can do something About.</h2>
<p class="highlighted">	Smoking   </p>

<p>This is the most important factor you can possibly do to help improve the quality and duration of your health. The effects of tobacco on health are enormous and evidence indisputable. Smoking is a significant factor in causation of Atherosclerosis, the pathology that causes heart attacks and strokes. Lung damage is predominately caused by cigarettes leading to asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. Multiple cancers are caused by smoking. </p>

<p class="highlighted">	Alcohol Abuse / Overuse</p>
<p>	This turns normal sensible people into dangerous people who harm others and themselves. Many accidents such as motor vehicle are caused by alcohol due to reckless driving and poor responses to incidents. Recreational accidents are often associated with alcohol use, such as drowning, falls, burns and firearms. Suicides often involve alcohol use. Liver and heart damage are common. Cancers are also caused by alcohol.  </p>

<p class="highlighted">	Obesity.   </p>
<p>The seriousness of this is often overlooked. Overweight people are becoming more common throughout the world. Obesity is often associated with heart, lung, muscular skeletal disease, falls, injury, and suffocation and choking. Lack of physical activity leads to many problems such as heart, lung and circulation diseases. Infections are more common and serious. Diagnostic difficulties occur and treatment is more difficult. Anesthetics and surgery are more complex and associated with higher risk. Cancers are more common.</p>

<p>There are no convincing general immune boosters of the immune system. So save your money and don’t buy these products. Good general health will ensure your immune system is healthy. You want a balanced healthy immune system. You do not want an overactive or boosted immune system as this can lead to allergies and auto immune diseases.</p>

<p class="highlighted">	Infective Agents.  </p>
<p> It is hard to believe that such a well understood medical entity as infections can be the fourth largest preventable cause of death in the developed world. In the underdeveloped world it is still often the number one killer. In poor communities in Africa diarrhea and malaria account for millions of deaths annually. In the first world Pneumonia is still common and the reason people usually die like most infections are not seeking medical help early enough. HIV and Malaria which are preventable still kills, as well as tetanus and staphylococcus infections, often mistaken for spider bites. TB and diarrheal diseases are still a problem due to lack of early correct medical intervention.  </p>

<p class="highlighted">	Pollutants.   </p>
<p> The AIR we breathe can become toxic with chemicals from factories, or misuse of machines in contained spaces is a common cause of death from carbon monoxide poisoning. The WATER and FOOD we eat may be poisoned with certain chemicals intentionally or accidentally. It may be our genetic makeup that causes certain foods harmless to others, to be extremely toxic to you. Obviously you need to be aware of this. Breast milk in a child with phenylketonuria PKU causes permanent severe brain damage! Remove an amino acid phenylalanine and the child is normal. 
Doctors when they give you medicines for anesthetics or diseases have a vast in depth knowledge of this chemical assault to ensure the benefits out way the risks. They need also to be checking many complex individual variants, that’s why asking for script over the phone, or adding it at the end of consult, is putting you at risk. Lots of these medicines are abused, it is a sad fact, but it is probably true that there are more addicts created by medical professional than the illicit drug trade. It is common for people to die from incorrect prescription drug use! The fault usually lies with patients using medication incorrectly or self-medicating!
Illicit drug use is a huge problem to health and will continue to grow. What is concerning is the incorrect myth that the drug such as cocaine are safe and can enhance life experience and personal performance. People will say anything to make money
